## Sigma OS Bootstrap

To bootstrap Sigma OS follow these steps:

1: Run the `build-crosscompiler.sh` script, with the *absolute* install address as an argument

2: Make sure the `x86_64-elf-gcc` and `x86_64-elf-as` compiled by the previous step are in your PATH

3: Clone the [Sigma OS](https://github.com/sigma-os/Sigma) repo

4: Run `make` in the Sigma OS directory
